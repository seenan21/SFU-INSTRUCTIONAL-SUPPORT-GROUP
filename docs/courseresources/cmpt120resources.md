# On Campus Help

## Accessing CSIL labs

SFU has Computer Labs accessible by all SFU computing students. CSIL are open to all students registered in a computing science (CMPT) course. Information and FAQs on CSIL can be accessed on the [CSIL webpage](http://www.sfu.ca/computing/about/support/csil.html)

- [Directions to the CSIL in Burnaby and Surrey ](http://www.sfu.ca/computing/about/support/csil/csil-directions.html)
- [Getting Started for CMPT Undergrads](http://www.sfu.ca/computing/about/support/getting-started.html)
- [General FAQ with regards to CSIL](http://www.sfu.ca/computing/about/support/csil/general.html)
- [CSIL Policies](http://www.sfu.ca/computing/about/support/csil/policies.html)

*TIP: The SFU Snap app has a room location feature and can be used to locate CSIL. View the official SFU app suite [here](http://www.sfu.ca/apps.html).*

## Peer Tutoring
SFU CS also provides a [peer tutoring](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/undergraduate-students/student-resources/cs_peer_tutoring1.html) program to provide extra support in learning difficult concepts or assignments. Peer tutors can be accessed both remote and in person.



# Setting up Python


## Compiling Python Programs
{: .no_toc}

1. Set up your environment
    - Open the terminal and check that you have python installed and check which version you have. Enter the following command: 'python --version'
    - If you need to [download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you can download the latest version from the official Python website. The website also contains updated documentation, guides, source code, etc.  
    - Install python. Installation guide for [Linux/Unix](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html), and [MacOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html) 
    - | Linux/Unix| Python should be pre-installed on your machine. If it isn’t you can download and after downloading and extracting the files, run the following commands in the respective directory:`>./configure` then  `>make` then  `>make altinstall` |
    | Windows | Follow the Python installation wizard instructions upon downloading the Python Windows installer version you need. After starting the installer you can select “Install Now” to install the default settings.|
    | MacOS   |  Macs come with Python pre-installed. If the version on your Mac is outdated, you can download and install the version you need by using the Python installation wizard. |

2. In interactive mode programming you can invoke the python interpreter by entering:  python. But by using your editor of choice you can write a python script ( “.py” file) and run it by entering the following in the terminal: python MyScript.py. This will compile and execute your script. 

3. If you are using an IDE, you can run and debug the script inside the IDE. 

## Recommended Python IDEs


An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an application where you can write code and then compile, execute, and debug your code. A text/code editor on the other hand only provides code/script writing and editing features only. If you write a script with a code editor, you will need to compile/execute it using the terminal or open it in an IDE. IDEs contain programming libraries and integrated tools for programmers to use during the programming process.

We recommend in using the following IDEs for CMPT 120:
- [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu/en/)
- [replit - online IDE](https://replit.com/site/ide)



# Assignment Download/Submission


## Zipping files

Many courses' assignments require .zip files/folders containing all of the code and its dependencies to be handed over during submission.
