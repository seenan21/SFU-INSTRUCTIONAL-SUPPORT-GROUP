### Compiling Python Programs

1. Set up your environment
    - Open the terminal and check that you have python installed and check which version you have. Enter the following command: 'python --version'
    - If you need to [download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you can download the latest version from the official Python website. The website also contains updated documentation, guides, source code, etc.  
    - Install python. Installation guide for [Linux/Unix](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html), and [MacOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html) 
    - | Linux/Unix| Python should be pre-installed on your machine. If it isn’t you can download and after downloading and extracting the files, run the following commands in the respective directory:`>./configure` then  `>make` then  `>make altinstall` |
    | Windows | Follow the Python installation wizard instructions upon downloading the Python Windows installer version you need. After starting the installer you can select “Install Now” to install the default settings.|
    | MacOS   |  Macs come with Python pre-installed. If the version on your Mac is outdated, you can download and install the version you need by using the Python installation wizard. |

2. In interactive mode programming you can invoke the python interpreter by entering:  python. But by using your editor of choice you can write a python script ( “.py” file) and run it by entering the following in the terminal: python MyScript.py. This will compile and execute your script. 

3. If you are using an IDE, you can run and debug the script inside the IDE. 


### How to compress files into a zipped folder

Many courses' assignments require .zip files/folders containing all of the code and its dependencies to be handed over during submission.
