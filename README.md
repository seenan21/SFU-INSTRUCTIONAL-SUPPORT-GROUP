How to set up the website:


## favicon

The code for the favicon is in the _includes folder named head_custom.html. For the favicon to be present in every page, you must ensure every doc is present in the root directory, not in any other subdirectory.

## Google analytics

To enable google analytics, ensure the ga-tracking in the _config.yml file has your google analytics measurement ID. 
Example: `ga-tracking: G-ZDXPF7GDG7`
