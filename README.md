How to set up the website:


## favicon

The code for the favicon is in the _includes folder named head_custom.html. For the favicon to be present in every page, you must ensure every doc is present in the root directory, not in any other subdirectory.

## Google analytics

To enable google analytics, go to head_custom.html in the _includes folder and replace the google measurement ID tag in the script with the ID of your Google analytics account.
